            <h2 id="sec2">2) How We Use Stored Data</h2>
            <p>We use stored data to:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Provide chat, notifications, and housing communications</li>
              <li>Support resident life operations (community updates, RA outreach, coordination)</li>
              <li>Investigate reports, policy violations, and safety concerns</li>

              <li>Meet institutional, legal, and record retention obligations</li>
            </ul>
      
            <h2 id="sec3">3) Who Can View Chat Data (Including “Deleted” Messages)</h2>
      
            <h3>A) Authorized Housing Personnel Access</h3>
            <p>
              CampusConnect is a university housing system. Resident Advisors (RAs) and Housing administrators may access chat history
              when they have a legitimate educational interest, such as:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>Responding to resident reports or safety concerns</li>
              <li>Addressing harassment, threats, or policy violations</li>
              <li>Supporting conduct or housing contract processes</li>
              <li>Managing official housing communications channels</li>
            </ul>
            <p class="note">
              Access is limited to authorized personnel, is role based, and may be logged and audited.
            </p>
      
            <h3>B) “Delete” Does Not Mean Erase From University Records</h3>
            <p>If you delete a chat message in CampusConnect:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>It may be removed from your view (and or marked as deleted in the conversation), but it may still be retained in:</li>
              <li>system logs</li>
              <li>backups</li>
              <li>audit records</li>
              <li>or administrative tools used for safety, compliance, and investigations</li>
            </ul>
            <p class="note">
              RAs and administrators can view and retrieve chat history even if a user deletes messages, when permitted by university policy and FERPA.
            </p>
      
            <h2 id="sec4">4) FERPA and “Education Records”</h2>
            <p>
              Some CampusConnect data, including certain chat communications, may qualify as an education record if it is directly related to a student and
              maintained by the university (or a party acting for the university).
            </p>
            <p>
              When CampusConnect data is treated as part of a student’s education record, FERPA governs how it may be accessed and disclosed.
            </p>
      
            <h2 id="sec5">5) Sharing Data Outside Housing</h2>
            <p>We do not sell student data.</p>
            <p>
              We may share information only as allowed by university policy and applicable law, including FERPA, such as:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>With other university offices (for example Student Conduct, Title IX, IT Security, Dean of Students) when needed for official purposes</li>
              <li>
                With vendors or service providers that help operate CampusConnect (for example hosting, customer support) only under contract and only to perform
                university functions, consistent with FERPA requirements for school officials
              </li>
              <li>With appropriate parties in a health or safety emergency when necessary to protect individuals</li>
              <li>When required by law (for example lawful court orders or subpoenas) under established university procedures</li>
            </ul>
      
            <h2 id="sec6">6) Data Retention</h2>
            <p>
              CampusConnect retains data according to the university’s records retention schedule and operational needs. Retention may be extended due to:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>investigations</li>
              <li>conduct or housing proceedings</li>
              <li>litigation holds</li>
              <li>or security incidents</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Backups may persist for a period of time even after content is no longer visible in the app.</p>
      
            <h2 id="sec7">7) Security</h2>
            <p>We use reasonable safeguards designed to protect CampusConnect data, such as:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>access controls based on role</li>
              <li>logging and auditing of administrative access</li>
              <li>secure hosting practices</li>
              <li>security monitoring</li>
            </ul>
            <p>No system can be guaranteed 100% secure.</p>
      
            <h2 id="sec8">8) Your FERPA Rights</h2>
            <p>Depending on your status as an eligible student, FERPA generally provides rights to:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>request to inspect and review your education records</li>
              <li>request amendment of records you believe are inaccurate or misleading</li>
              <li>
                have some control over disclosures of education records, with exceptions
                (such as disclosures to school officials with legitimate educational interest)
              </li>
              <li>file a complaint with the U.S. Department of Education’s Student Privacy Policy Office</li>
            </ul>
      
            <p class="note">
